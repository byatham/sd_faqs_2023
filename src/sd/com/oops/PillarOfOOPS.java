	//1. Encapslation
	
	//define attributes as private
	// define public methods with setters and getters
	
	
	//2. Polymorphism
	// by using overloading and overriding we can achieve Polymorphism
	// *** over loading***
	//in same class possible
	// by changing order of parameters and types of parameter we can achieve
	// calling as compile time 
	
	// *** overriding ***
	// possible in two different classes with inheritance relation
	// method name and signature should be same
	// calling as runtime polymorphism
	
	//3.Inheritance
	
	//in inheritance we will use re usability purpose
	// we can achieve among classes by using extends 
	// with class and interface by using implements
	
	
	//Abstraction
// hiding the implementation details and showing functionality the user is called abstraction
	//by using interfaces and abstract class
